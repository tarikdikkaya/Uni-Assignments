# A kNN Implementation

## Our goal is to decide which class does a wine belong which features of it is given.
## In this project, there are 2 code files written in Python. "knn.py" is a kNN implementation from scratch. The procedures of plotting, data visualisation, data processing etc. were explained and applied in the "main.ipynb" file. You can easily run the code blocks by clicking the run button right next to them (make sure you run them from up to down). Feel free to make any changes you want and compare with the results you obtained.
